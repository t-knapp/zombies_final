Few things to note and keep track of:

    ALL CODE
        must be tabbed (tab = 4 spaces)
        must use naming conventions that include underscores ONLY (e.g. this_function() intead of thisFunction() or ThisFunction() etc)
        bracing rules:
            function calls will have spaces if there are parameters - self explode( "violently" ); otherwise self explode();
                EXCEPT C-like utility functions (i.e. strtok, strstr, etc)
            statement calls will have spaces before and after () - while ( 1 )
            curly braces immediately follow declarations - for ( ;; ) { or cool_function() {
            curly braces end on their own line, unless using single line of code - return_this() { return 1; }
            no braces are required for single lines (only optional)
        variables MUST use Hungarian notation:
            prefix      type
            a           array
            b           boolean
            c           char
            d           double
            e           entity
            f           float
            g           flag
            i           int
            k           constant
            l           localized string
            o           object
            p           function
            s           string
            t           thread
            v           vector
            
            UNLESS the variable is used in a for loop, i.e. for ( i = 0; i < xxx; i++ )
        all utilities will be stored in the utilities.gsc in /code/ - they are easily accessible like utilities::some_function();
        every file must have a new line at the end
        all functions that need to be accessible by more than one file must be registered by [[ level.register ]] (excluding utilities)
        each file must include the copyright notice ;)
